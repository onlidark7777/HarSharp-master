A small and easy-to-use library to parse HTTP Archive (HAR) format to .NET objects.

--------

## Introduction
The HTTP Archive (HAR) format as defined in the [W3C Specification](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/HAR/Overview.html) is an archival format for HTTP transactions that can be used by a web browser to export detailed performance data about web pages it loads.

So, every modern browser nowadays can export HAR with a lot of information about the user navigation. Chrome, for example, can export HAR from Developer Tools, Network tab, right mouse click and "Copy all as HAR".

What I can do with HAR data?
Well, there a lot of things I can imagine right now, like:
- Web performance tests runners
- Performance analyzers
- Navigation visualizers

## Setup

#### NuGet
```shell
install-package HarSharp
```

--------

## Usage
### Deserialize from string
```csharp
var har = HarConvert.Deserialize(harContent);
```

### Deserialize from file
```csharp
var har = HarConvert.DeserializeFromFile(fileName);
```

### Listing pages load time
```csharp
var har = HarConvert.Deserialize(harContent);

foreach(var page in har.Log.Pages)
{
	Console.WriteLine(
	"Page: {0} loaded in {1} milliseconds", 
	page.Title, 
	page.PageTimings.OnLoad);
}
```

## Code philosophy
The idea of HarSharp is simplify and promote the use of HAR in .NET codes and keep closest possible to [W3C specification](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/HAR/Overview.html) , for this reason the below rules were followed during the library development:
- Keep the entities and properties names equals to the one defined in the [specification](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/HAR/Overview.html), but follow the C# naming guidelines, so, "pages" became "Pages".
- Keep the properties types closest to the spec, but change when there is a better type on .NET side.
	- string (ISO 8601 - YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD): System.DateTime (UTC).
	- string (url): System.Uri.
- Full documentation using citations from W3C specification.
- StyleCop validation.
- FxCop Validation.
- 100% unit test coverage
